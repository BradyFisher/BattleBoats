## Battle Boats Game Definition
Battleboats is a game where a computer places "boats" on a grid of squares(hidden from the player). The goal of the game is to sink all of the computer's ships by guessing their locations and "firing shots" at them.

The board gets marked with a hit("H") if a shot hits the computer's boat, and a miss("M") if a shot misses the computer's boat.

The game can be run with differnet board sizes: from 3x3 to 12x12 with different numbers of boats depending on the board size. The boats are all 3 units long.
